                            Was a renowned Indian political leader whose ideology was rooted in the principles of non-violence, truth, and self-reliance. He firmly believed that non-violence was the most potent weapon for fighting oppression and injustice. He's philosophy of non-violence or 'Ahimsa' was not limited to the physical act of refraining from violence but also included the mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of non-violence. He also believed in the importance of truth and considered it to be the cornerstone of a just society. Gandhi's emphasis on self-reliance led him to promote economic and social equality, and he strongly believed in the idea of 'Swadeshi', which called for the use of locally produced goods to promote self-sufficiency. Gandhi's leadership in the Indian independence movement inspired similar movements for civil rights and self-determination around the world, and his ideology continues to be relevant and influential to this day.

                <h3 class="history-title">From South Africa to Indian Independence</h3>

                <p class="history-paragraph">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. He was the youngest of four children in a Hindu merchant family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a Diwan (prime minister) in the Porbandar state.</p>

                <p class="history-paragraph"> He studied law in London and later returned to India to practice law. In 1893, he traveled to South Africa to work as a lawyer It was during this time that he developed his philosophy of non-violent resistance, which he called 'Satyagraha'.</p>

                <p class="history-paragraph">Gandhi's experiences in South Africa transformed him into a political activist and a leader of the Indian community there. He became involved in the fight against discrimination and segregation faced by Indians living in South Africa, particularly the Transvaal Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, which required Indians to carry a pass at all times and subjected them to other forms of harassment and abuse.</p>

                <p class="history-paragraph">Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and quickly became involved in the Indian independence movement. He led a number of campaigns against British rule, including the Salt March in 1930 and the Quit India Movement in 1942. Gandhi was imprisoned numerous times for his activism, but continued to advocate for non-violent resistance and civil disobedience as a means of achieving independence.</p>

                <p class="history-paragraph">In 1947, India gained independence from British rule, but was partitioned into India and Pakistan, leading to widespread violence and displacement. Gandhi continued to work for peace and reconciliation, but was assassinated in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with his policies.</p>
                
                <p class="history-paragraph">Gandhi's legacy of non-violent resistance and civil disobedience continues to inspire people around the world, and his life and work remain an important part of Indian and world history. He was a champion of human rights, social justice, and equality, and his philosophy of Satyagraha has been used in many other civil rights movements, including those led by Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi is revered in India as the "Father of the Nation" and is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.</p>
